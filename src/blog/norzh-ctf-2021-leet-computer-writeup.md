# NorzhCTF 2021 - Leet Computer

## The Challenge

> One of the attacker is still in the airport hall, and it seems that he is still connected to the airport wifi ! Get a root shell on its machine to continue your investigation. This challenge will give you access to another network.
> 
> \- by Masterfox

## Context

NorzhCTF was a hackquest style CTF so we had to complete another challenge first to unlock this. The previous challenge was to get a shell on the 'attacker's machine and this one was a privilege escalation challenge.

## Tl;dr

```sh
./mail_scan.py --ip '010.001.001.001' --mail $'"\nos.execute("cat /root/flag") -- '
```

## How we solved it

For this CTF I was on the Digital Overdose CTF team and my one of my teammates had completed the previous challenge. I was looking around the machine for any obviously exploitable things but I couldn't find much at all. One of my teammates noticed that the user (e11i0t) already had sudo. They ran `sudo -l` and found that the user could only run one file with sudo called `mail_scan.py`. `sudo -l` is quite a useful command that I didn't know about before and I don't think I could have completed the challenge without my teammate introducing it to me (thanks [@revdev1337](https://twitter.com/revdev1337 "Twitter: @revdev1337")). Below is the contents of `mail_scan.py`.

Attempts to exploit a remote command execution vulnerability in misconfigured Dovecot/Exim mail servers.

It is important to note that the mail server will not return the output of the command. The mail server
also wont allow space characters but they can be replaced with "${{IFS}}". Commands can also be
concatenated with "``". The script takes care of the conversion automatically.

I read through the code and figured that it was creating an nmap script, saving it to a temp file and running it ðŸš¨ with user supplied input ðŸš¨.

The program took two parameters; ip, and mail. First I checked the ip regex (as the ip was inserted straight into a shell command) and I thought I might be able to get around the check by including a newline in the ip address, however this didn't work as the multiline option was not specified in the regex and therefore the `^` and `$` were the start and end of the string not the line. The payload I tried is below;

```sh
# the regex is a bit weird so the components of the ip all have to be three digits
sudo ./mail_scan.py --ip $'010.001.001.001\n; echo hi' --mail 'blah'
```

Circumventing the regex didn't work however I could verify that inserting a newline into the argument had worked.

Next I looked at how `args.mail` was being used and found that it was getting inserted straight into the nmap script with no sanitisation. I tried injecting a quotation mark into the mail parameter and it did indeed throw an error when running the nmap script.

Nmap scripts are written in lua so I just injected a call to `os.execute` to read the flag. This means that if nmap finds an open mail port we get the flag, all I had to do now was point it at a server with a mail port open.

```sh
./mail_scan.py --ip '010.001.001.001' --mail $'"\nos.execute("cat /root/flag") -- '
```

And there you go, we have the flag; `NORZH{e11i0t_1s_s0_1337!!}`

## What I learnt

1. `sudo -l` is really useful for finding what commands a user can run as root
2. it is trivial to add newlines to command line arguments
3. DONT EVER USE UNSANITISED USER INPUT

## Conclusion

This challenge was a nice confidence boost after working away at 3 other challenges and not being able to solve any of them.

Overall NorzhCTF was a very unique competition and I found the hackquest style quite interesting, however I still prefer jeopardy style CTFs for now because they are more beginner friendly.
