# G'day

G'day, I'm [@stackotter](https://github.com/stackotter); an Australian software developer with a love for Swift, Svelte, and Rust. I spend most of my spare time working on open-source Swift projects, going bouldering, and occasionally writing articles if I find something interesting enough.

To learn more about my open-source projects and contributions, check out [my page about my open-source presence](/open-source), and [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/stackotter).

## Current projects

- [SwiftCrossUI](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui) — a cross-platform declarative UI framework inspired by SwiftUI and native on all supported platforms.
- [Swift Bundler](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler) — a tool for creating cross-platform Swift apps.
- [Delta Client](https://deltaclient.app) — an open-source 'Minecraft: Java Edition' client created in Swift for macOS with efficiency in mind.
