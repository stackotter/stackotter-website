# G'day

G'day, I'm [@stackotter](https://github.com/stackotter); an Australian software developer with a love for Swift, Svelte, and Rust. I spend most of my spare time working on open-source Swift projects, going bouldering, and occasionally writing articles if I find something interesting enough.

## Current projects

- [Delta Client](https://github.com/stackotter/delta-client) — an open-source Minecraft Java Edition client created in Swift for macOS with efficiency in mind.
- [Swift Bundler](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler) — a tool for creating macOS apps with Swift packages instead of Xcode projects.
- [SwiftCrossUI](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui) — a declarative UI framework (similar to SwiftUI) for creating cross-platform desktop apps with Swift.
