     <p>I love developing open-source software for the community, and I never expect anything in return. However this is not sustainable if I want to continue being an open-source developer; The less money I make from open-source, the less time I will be able to spend making tools and packages for the community.</p> 
     <p>It is for this reason that I have decided to make Swift Bundler sponsor-only while I tackle the brunt of its development: i.e. bringing it to new platforms, stabilising it, and creating powerful new features to enhance productivity.</p> 
     <h2 id="getting-the-sponsor-only-version">Getting the sponsor-only version ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2> 
     <p>The sponsor-only version of Swift Bundler is available exclusively to my monthly sponsors. When you <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/stackotter">become a monthly sponsor</a> you are automatically granted access to the private <code>swift-bundler-early-access</code> repository. The sponsor-only version already includes basic iOS support on the <code>ios</code> branch.</p> 
     <h2 id="existing-users">Existing users üë®‚Äçüíª</h2> 
     <p>Don‚Äôt worry, <a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler">the Swift Bundler you know and love</a> ‚Äì the one that can only make macOS apps ‚Äì is still available for free, but it won‚Äôt be getting any new features or bug fixes until further notice.</p> 
     <h2 id="an-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend">An enemy of my enemy is my friend ü§ù</h2> 
     <p>We‚Äôre all enemies of the proprietary xcodeproj project format. And as friends we can work together towards a more open and developer-friendly future. No more xcodeproj-related merge conflicts, relying on a <em>30gb</em> IDE, or waiting for Apple to fix bugs. It‚Äôs time for an open-source approach to Swift app development.</p>
