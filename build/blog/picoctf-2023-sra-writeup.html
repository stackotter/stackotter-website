    <h2 id="what-is-rsa">What is RSA?</h2> 
    <p>RSA is a relatively simple asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithm (the encryption key and decryption key are different).</p> 
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">wikipedia page for RSA</a> has a great explanation of the maths behind RSA.</p> 
    <p>Applied to the context of this challenge, hereâ€™s what we know:</p> 
    <pre><code class="language-txt">p is a 128-bit prime (would usually be much larger)
q is a 128-bit prime (would also usually be much larger)

n = pq
e = 65537 (would usually be chosen based on some constraints)
Ï†(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
d â‰¡ e^(-1) (mod Ï†(n))

ciphertext â‰¡ plaintext^e (mod n)
plaintext â‰¡ ciphertext^d (mod n)
</code></pre> 
    <p>Figure 1: <em>SRA overview</em></p> 
    <h2 id="the-code">The code</h2> 
    <p>The challenge essentially implements the algorithm outlined above to encrypt a randomly generated sequence of 16 ascii letters and digits. It then prints out <code>d</code> (<code>anger</code>) and <code>ciphertext</code> (<code>envy</code>) and gets us to enter the plaintext. If we get the plaintext correct, we get the flag.</p> 
    <pre><code class="language-python">from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime, inverse, bytes_to_long
from string import ascii_letters, digits
from random import choice

pride = "".join(choice(ascii_letters + digits) for _ in range(16))
gluttony = getPrime(128) # p
greed = getPrime(128) #    q
lust = gluttony * greed #  n
sloth = 65537 #            e
envy = inverse(sloth, (gluttony - 1) * (greed - 1)) # d

anger = pow(bytes_to_long(pride.encode()), sloth, lust)

print(f"{anger = }")
print(f"{envy = }")

print("vainglory?")
vainglory = input("&gt; ").strip()

if vainglory == pride:
    print("Conquered!")
    with open("/challenge/flag.txt") as f:
        print(f.read())
else:
    print("Hubris!")
</code></pre> 
    <p>Figure 2: <em>chal.py</em></p> 
    <p>The most important question to answer is what we need to decrypt the ciphertext.</p> 
    <h2 id="what-do-we-need">What do we need?</h2> 
    <p>Recall the last equation from Figure 1; Weâ€™ve got <code>ciphertext</code> and <code>d</code>, all we need is <code>n</code>. Canâ€™t be too hard, right?</p> 
    <pre><code class="language-txt">plaintext â‰¡ ciphertext^d (mod n)
</code></pre>

    <h2 id="maths-time">Maths time!</h2> 
    <pre><code class="language-txt"># Some useful information
n = pq
e = 65537 (would usually be chosen based on some constraints)
Ï†(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)

# Rearrange some modular arithmetic
d â‰¡ e^(-1) (mod Ï†(n))
ed â‰¡ 1 (mod Ï†(n))
ed - 1 â‰¡ 0 (mod Ï†(n))

# The `mod Ï†(n)` essentially means get the remainder dividing by Ï†(n)
# Thus, if the remainder is 0, `ed - 1` is a multiple of Ï†(n)
ed - 1 = Ï†(n) * k, where k is an integer

ed - 1 = (p - 1) * (q - 1) * k
</code></pre> 
    <p>Figure 4: <em>the maths</em></p> 
    <p>With the final rearranged equation in mind, thereâ€™s a pretty naÃ¯ve solution that we can try. It could be too slow, but itâ€™s always best to try it first and optimise later.</p> 
    <h2 id="the-approach">The approach</h2> 
    <p>The basis of this approach is that <code>p - 1</code> and <code>q - 1</code> will be divisors of <code>ed - 1</code>. Therefore, in theory, we can just list all divisors of <code>ed - 1</code> and then find all of the divisors are 1 less than a 128-bit prime. We can then take all of those possible values of <code>p - 1</code> and <code>q - 1</code>, add one to them, and go through all combinations of possible values for <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>. For each combination we can attempt to decrypt the ciphertext, and if the output is a string of ascii letters and digits, weâ€™ve probably found the correct value. If we get lucky, there werenâ€™t be too many divisors.</p> 
    <pre><code class="language-python">from Crypto.Util.number import isPrime, long_to_bytes
from string import ascii_letters, digits
from itertools import combinations
from sympy import divisors
from math import log2

anger = int(input("anger = "))
envy = int(input("envy = "))
sloth = 65537

ds = divisors(envy * sloth - 1)
primes = [x + 1 for x in ds if isPrime(x + 1)]
correct_size_primes = [x for x in primes if log2(x) // 1 == 127]

valid_plaintexts = []
charset = ascii_letters + digits
for p, q in combinations(correct_size_primes, 2):
    try:
        s = long_to_bytes(pow(anger, envy, p * q)).decode("ascii")
        if all([c in charset for c in s]):
            valid_plaintexts.append(s)
    except Exception:
        continue

print(valid_plaintexts)

    <h2 id="does-it-work">Does it work?</h2> 
    <p>The short answer; most of the time?</p> 
    <pre><code class="language-txt">anger = 24398438998096796505136585754485122083423993128182088895588693010516281150000
envy = 79858385363514967732413083778555381826816038680345822674623719303400035174513
["HGWW0Lhmhzatb2Ul"]
</code></pre> 
    <p>Figure 6: <em>it works! (in 1 minute and 16 seconds)</em></p> 
    <p>In practice, this approach is a bit hit and miss because the line <code>ds = divisors(envy * sloth - 1)</code> can take an awfully long amount of time if you get unlucky and <code>ed - 1</code> ends up having an incredibly large amount of possible divisors. It works around 30-50% of the time in my experience which is certainly good enough for a CTF challenge solution ðŸ˜….</p> 
    <h2 id="possible-optimisations-for-fun-no-profit">Possible optimisations (for fun, no profit)</h2> 
    <p>During the CTF I just moved on after solving the challenge, as you do, but afterwards I read <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/105734/crack-rsa-with-e-and-d">a clever â€˜writeupâ€™</a> (answer on StackExchange) in which the hacker instead found the prime factors of <code>ed - 1</code> (much faster than finding all possible divisors). They then took the log (base 2) of each factor and used that to figure out which factors multiply together to make 128-bit numbers (if a prime is 128-bit, subtracting 1 still gives you a 128-bit number because 2^127, the smallest 128-bit number, isnâ€™t prime). The rest of the approach is the same, but in theory it should run much faster. I havenâ€™t personally tried out this approach, but if you do Iâ€™d be interested to hear how much of an improvement it gives.</p> 
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> 
    <p>Iâ€™ve always wanted to get into cryptography challenges more (as a binary exploitation guy). And in my opinion, this challenge was a great introduction to RSA challenges, and didnâ€™t require a prohibitive amount of maths (although take that with a grain of salt coming from a guy doing a bachelor of maths).</p>
