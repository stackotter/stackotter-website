     <h3 id="swiftcrossui">SwiftCrossUI</h3> 
     <p><a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui">SwiftCrossUI</a> is a declarative cross-platform UI framework inspired by Apple’s SwiftUI. It support macOS, iOS, tvOS, Windows, and Linux, with Android support on the way. Under-the-hood it uses each platform’s native UI framework to provide a native user experience.</p> 
     <h3 id="swift-bundler">Swift Bundler</h3> 
     <p><a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler">Swift Bundler</a> is a modern tool for creating cross-platform Swift apps using Swift packages instead of Xcodeproj’s. It supports macOS, iOS, tvOS, Windows, and Linux. It makes cross-platform app development and distribution a breeze. Swift Bundler apps can be packaged to <code>.app</code> for Apple platforms, <code>.msi</code> for Windows, and <code>.rpm</code> for Linux.</p> 
     <h3 id="delta-client">Delta Client</h3> 
     <p><a href="https://deltaclient.app">Delta Client</a> is a complete rewrite of the ‘Minecraft: Java Edition’ client. It is fully compatible with ‘Minecraft: Java Edition’ servers and is written in Swift. Due to a lot of optimisations and better design decisions, it is multiple times faster and more efficient than any other Minecraft client. The website contains more specific metrics.</p> 
     <h3 id="swiftmacrotoolkit">SwiftMacroToolkit</h3> 
     <p>Did you know that <code>-0xF_ep-0_2</code> is a valid floating point literal in Swift? Well you probably didn’t (it’s equal to -63.5), and as a macro author you shouldn’t even have to care! Among many things, <a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-macro-toolkit">SwiftMacroToolkit</a> shields you from edge cases so that users can use your macros in whatever weird (but correct) manners they may desire.</p> 
     <p><a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-macro-toolkit">SwiftMacroToolkit</a>’s aim is to take the complexity out of writing correct and robust Swift macros by providing a more semantic view of Swift code.</p> 
     <h3 id="swiftprotobufgen">SwiftProtobufGen</h3> 
     <p><a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-protobuf-gen">SwiftProtobufGen</a> is a tool for generating Protobuf message definitions from Swift structs. It can also generate the code required to convert to and from Protobuf messages. It is not yet in a usable state, but if there is enough interest I will continue working on it at some point.</p> 
     <h3 id="swiftcssparser">SwiftCSSParser</h3> 
     <p><a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-css-parser">SwiftCSSParser</a> is a Swift package which provides a type-safe API for parsing, modifying and serializing CSS. It is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/cssparser">c++ cssparser library</a>. I used it to create a page-content aware css minifier for my static static generator – <a href="https://github.com/stackotter/Scute">Scute</a> – and it seems to be performing well.</p> 
     <h3 id="swiftmixin">SwiftMixin</h3> 
     <p><a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-mixin">SwiftMixin</a> is a highly experimental Swift package for replacing functions and methods dynamically at runtime. It only supports x86_64 and will probably break with every new Swift release. I plan on eventually writing an article about what I learnt from creating the package.</p>

     <h3 id="flyingfox">FlyingFox</h3> 
     <p>In 2022 I found two security vulnerabilities in <a href="https://github.com/swhitty/FlyingFox">FlyingFox</a> – a Swift HTTP implementation which takes advantage of Swift concurrency. <a href="https://github.com/swhitty/FlyingFox/issues/24">The first vulnerability</a> was a path traversal vulnerability giving access to all of a server’s files. And <a href="https://github.com/swhitty/FlyingFox/issues/26">the second vulnerability</a> was a pointer arithmetic error in the socket implementation which could leak unintended memory to a user under certain conditions. Both of them have now been fixed.</p> 
     <h3 id="parsley">Parsley</h3> 
     <p>In 2022 I brought <a href="https://github.com/loopwerk/Parsley">Parsley</a> (a Swift wrapper of the cmark-gfm markdown parser) up-to-date with the latest version of cmark-gfm to mitigate the multiple vulnerabilities that it was exposed to. Most importantly, <a href="https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-mc3g-88wq-6f4x">the arbitrary code execution vulnerability in table parsing</a>. I also added support for custom markdown syntax extensions so that I could use it in my Swift-based static site generator – <a href="https://github.com/stackotter/Scute">Scute</a>.</p> 
     <h3 id="tomlkit">TOMLKit</h3> 
     <p>TOML is my favourite configuration file format and I think that <a href="https://github.com/Lebje/TOMLKit">LebJe’s TOMLKit</a> is a great step towards increasing adoption of TOML among Swift programmers. In 2022 I fixed a fatal parsing error that could occur when an array was provided in a place that TOMLKit expected a table.</p>
