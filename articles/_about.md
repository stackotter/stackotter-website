# G'day

G'day, I'm [@stackotter](https://twitter.com/stackotter); an Australian software developer, ethical hacker, and creator of [delta client](https://github.com/stackotter/delta-client) (an open source rewrite of Minecraft compatible with Java edition). I also like doing a bit of design here and there (I made that pixel art logo), and I can solve a rubiks cube in 18 seconds on average.

## Notable projects

- [Delta Client](https://github.com/stackotter/delta-client) — an open source Minecraft Java Edition client created in Swift for macOS with efficiency in mind. I use Apple's Metal 2 framework (a modern Apple version of OpenGL) for the rendering.
- [Musotools](https://github.com/stackotter/musotools) — a novelty command line beat sequencer using ncurses.
- [Pygeddon](https://github.com/stackotter/pygeddon) — some of the features of airgeddon remade in python mac (i don't think it works with the latest macOS anymore though).
