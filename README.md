# Personal Website

Source code for my personal website. The site is created with Scute (my custom static site generation tool) and hosted on GitHub pages.

## Prerequisites

Building and previewing the site requires [scute](https://github.com/stackotter/scute) to be installed.

```sh
mint install stackotter/scute
```

## Running

```sh
scute preview
```

## Building

```sh
# Builds the site to `./out`.
scute build
```
